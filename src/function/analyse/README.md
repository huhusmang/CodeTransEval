Visualization Ideas for Code Translation Model Performance Data:
This data provides a rich opportunity for various visualizations to understand the performance of different code translation models across various tasks. Here are some ideas:
Overall Performance:
Bar chart of Pass@1 rate: Compare the Pass@1 rate for each model across all tasks. This will quickly show which models perform best overall.
Stacked bar chart of Answer_type_nums: Show the distribution of answer types (all_passed, compilation_failed, etc.) for each model. This reveals the types of errors each model is prone to making.
Scatter plot of Pass@1 rate vs. CodeBLEU score: Explore the correlation between Pass@1 rate and CodeBLEU score for each model and task. This helps assess if CodeBLEU score is a good indicator of actual translation success.
Task-Specific Performance:
Grouped bar chart of Pass@1 rate by task: Compare the Pass@1 rate for each model within each specific task (e.g., c++_java, python_c++). This helps identify which models excel at specific translation directions.
Heatmap of Average_passed_testcase_rates: Visualize the average passed testcase rates for each model and task combination. This provides a more granular view of performance within each task.
Line chart of Pass@1 estimates for each problem: For a specific model and task, plot the Pass@1 estimates for each individual problem. This reveals which problems are more challenging for the model.
Additional Visualizations:
Boxplot of CodeBLEU sub-scores: Compare the distribution of individual CodeBLEU sub-scores (ngram_match_score, syntax_match_score, etc.) across models and tasks. This provides insights into specific aspects of translation quality.
Network graph of model relationships: Create a network graph where nodes represent models and edges represent similarities in their performance across tasks. This could reveal clusters of models with similar strengths and weaknesses.
Tips:
Use color effectively to distinguish models and tasks.
Include clear labels and titles for each visualization.
Consider interactive visualizations to allow exploration of specific data points and comparisons.
You can also combine multiple visualizations into a dashboard for a comprehensive overview of model performance.
These are just a few ideas, and the best visualizations will depend on your specific goals and the questions you want to answer.
